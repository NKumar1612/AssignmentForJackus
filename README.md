# Assignment for Jackus

## Technologies used:

- To run the react application: \

## Reflection on Assignment:

It was a really fun assignment to do, but i think i could've made some more changes if i had more timeframe:

- Add a 404 Page, to add more interactivity, and make the app more engaging.
- Add a verification for the email, to check if the email was valid or not.
- Add a custom message for the delete notif.
- Added a route for Edit Form, so the User Dashboard and Create Button would've not been visible, when doing it, to make the code look more professional.
- My Create Page needs some more debugging.
